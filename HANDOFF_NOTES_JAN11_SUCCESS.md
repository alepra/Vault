## üîß **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

### **1. Trading Interface Disappearing Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** Trading interface would disappear when clicked due to navigation conflicts
**Solution:** Implemented proper display mode tracking (`currentDisplayMode`) to prevent automatic phase switching from overriding manual navigation
**Files Modified:** `client/game-interface.html` - lines 395-404, 922, 940, 1142
**Result:** Trading interface now stays open when clicked

### **2. Human Player Net Worth Calculation - FIXED ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** Net worth showing incorrect values (not adding up to $1000)
**Solution:** Fixed capital tracking in IPO module - now properly updates `remainingCapital` and `totalSpent` instead of modifying base `capital` field
**Files Modified:** 
- `server/modules/ipoModule.js` - lines 149-150, 414-415
- `server/index.js` - line 419
**Result:** Net worth now correctly shows `remainingCapital + (shares √ó currentPrice)`

### **3. Multi-Browser Synchronization - FIXED ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** Each browser created separate sessions, so other live players didn't show up
**Solution:** Changed from random session IDs to shared session ID (`'shared_game'`)
**Files Modified:** `client/game-interface.html` - line 1542
**Result:** Multiple browsers now share the same game session and see each other

### **4. Trading Order Processing - FIXED ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** "Nothing happens when submitting orders" - orders weren't being processed
**Solution:** 
- Enabled `weeklyTrading = true` in trading module
- Added immediate order processing with `processImmediateOrder()` method
- Orders now execute in real-time instead of waiting for batch processing
**Files Modified:** `server/modules/tradingModule.js` - lines 366, 107, 110-131
**Result:** Buy/sell orders now execute immediately and show in ticker tape

## üöÄ **SERVER CONNECTION ISSUES - COMPLETELY RESOLVED:**

### **The Root Problem:**
Previous agent struggled with 404 errors because Python server was running from wrong directory

### **The Solution:**
**Correct Startup Method:**
1. **Use `SIMPLE_START.bat`** (created today) - this is the working batch file
2. **Python server runs from ROOT directory** (`C:\Users\alepr\Lemonade Stand`)
3. **Correct URL:** `http://localhost:8080/client/game-interface.html` (note the `/client/` in path)

### **Why This Works:**
- Python server serves files from root directory
- URL includes `/client/` to access the HTML file in the client subdirectory
- Cache-busting headers already in HTML prevent 404 caching issues

### **Files Created:**
- `SIMPLE_START.bat` - **THIS IS THE WORKING BATCH FILE** ‚úÖ

## üé® **COSMETIC FIXES COMPLETED:**

### **IPO Page Display - FIXED ‚úÖ**
**User Request:** Clean up IPO submission page text
**Changes Made:**
1. Capitalized "Game Phase" ‚Üí "GAME PHASE"
2. Removed "ipo" text 
3. Moved "üéØ IPO BIDDING" to same line as "GAME PHASE:"
**Result:** Now displays as "GAME PHASE: üéØ IPO BIDDING" - professional, clean, one line
**Files Modified:** `client/game-interface.html` - lines 80, 431
