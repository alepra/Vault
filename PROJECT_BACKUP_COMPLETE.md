## üíª TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Current Working Code
**File**: `test-interface/app3.js`
**Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
**Features**: All economic calculations, real-time updates, market share

### Key Functions:
- `mapPrice(level)`: Converts 1-10 slider to $0.75-$2.25
- `mapCost(level)`: Converts 1-10 slider to $0.50-$2.00
- `calculateReputationPenalty()`: Price gouging penalties
- `calculateMarketingEffectiveness()`: Diminishing returns
- `calculateWeatherMultiplier()`: Weather impact on demand
- `calculateEconomyMultiplier()`: Kid-friendly economy impact

### Economic Formulas:
```javascript
// Total market demand
totalDemand = baseDemand * weatherMultiplier * economyMultiplier

// Market share calculation
attractiveness = reputation * marketingEffectiveness * qualityAppeal
marketShare = attractiveness / (attractiveness + competitors)

// Units sold
units = totalDemand * marketShare

// Profit calculation
revenue = price * units
ingredientCost = cost * units
marketingSpend = revenue * marketingPercentage
profit = revenue - ingredientCost - marketingSpend
```
