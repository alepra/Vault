# WORKING STATE - JANUARY 14, 2025

## ✅ **WHAT WAS WORKING SUCCESSFULLY:**

### **Fixed Issues:**
1. **Net Worth Display** - Fixed to show correct $1000.00 values using `ledger.totalNetWorth`
2. **Stock Holdings Display** - Fixed to show itemized holdings for each participant
3. **Trading Interface** - Functional and ready for testing
4. **Game Flow** - Working from IPO through trading phase
5. **Server Setup** - Both servers running properly

### **Working Configuration:**
- **Backend:** `server/index-modular.js` on port 3001
- **Frontend:** `client/game-interface.html` served by Python HTTP server on port 8080
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8080/game-interface.html?fresh=true&cb=20250114001`

### **Key Files Modified:**
- `client/game-interface.html` - Fixed net worth display, stock holdings, trading interface
- `server/index-modular.js` - Working server with all modules
- `START_GAME_CACHE_BUSTED.bat` - Working batch file

### **Status Before Issues:**
- ✅ IPO phase working correctly
- ✅ Net worth calculations accurate
- ✅ Stock holdings displayed properly
- ✅ Trading interface functional
- ✅ All participants showing correct financial data

## **ISSUE THAT BROKE EVERYTHING:**
- Added "Start New Game" button functionality
- Modified batch file incorrectly
- Server startup issues due to directory problems

## **SOLUTION:**
- Revert to the working state before the "Start New Game" button was added
- Use the working batch file configuration
- Keep all the display and functionality fixes that were working
