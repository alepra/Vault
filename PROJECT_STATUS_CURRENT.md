const mapCost = (level) => 0.50 + (2.00 - 0.50) * ((level - 1) / 9);
const calculateReputationPenalty = (priceLevel, qualityLevel) => { /* logic */ };
const calculateMarketingEffectiveness = (marketingPct) => { /* logic */ };
```

- Aggressive, Conservative, Concentrated, Diversified
- Value Investor, Growth Focused, Momentum Trader
