## 🎮 **HOW TO PLAY:**

1. **Start the Game:**
   ```bash
   .\START_GAME_CACHE_BUSTED.bat
   ```

2. **Access the Game:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8080/client/game-interface.html
   - Backend: http://localhost:3001

3. **Game Flow:**
   - Enter your name and join the game
   - Submit IPO bids (scavenger bots bid automatically)
   - Click "Ready for Next Phase" after IPO completes
   - Submit buy/sell orders in trading interface
   - Watch your portfolio update in real-time!

## 📊 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:**

### Event Flow (Working):
```
Client submits order → server/index.js:submitTradingOrder
→ tradingModule.processImmediateOrder
→ tradingModule.executeMarketOrder (returns trades)
→ tradingModule.emit('tradesExecuted', {companyId, trades})
→ server/index.js:tradesExecuted handler
→ io.to(socket.sessionId).emit('tradesExecuted', payload)
→ client/game-interface.html:tradesExecuted handler
→ fetchLedgerData() + updateYourPortfolio() + updateParticipantsDisplay()
```

### Key Files:
- `server/index.js` - Main server with WebSocket routing
- `server/modules/tradingModule.js` - Core trading logic
- `server/modules/ipoModule.js` - Dutch auction and bot bidding
- `client/game-interface.html` - Frontend interface
- `START_GAME_CACHE_BUSTED.bat` - Game launcher

## 🔧 **DEBUGGING COMMANDS:**

```bash
# Check if servers are running
netstat -an | findstr "3001\|8080"

# Check server logs for trading events
# Look for: "📤 Emitting tradesExecuted to client"

# Check client console for updates
# Look for: "📨 Client received tradesExecuted event"
```

## 🛡️ **PROTECTION STRATEGY:**

1. **Always use `START_GAME_CACHE_BUSTED.bat`** - This is the working version
2. **Avoid the "clean architecture" version** - It has different issues
